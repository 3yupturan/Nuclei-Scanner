// The function is a package called "automaticscan2." It is used to implement automated template execution based on fingerprint results.
//
// First, it performs fingerprint detection using the "tech" tag.
// It extracts all the tags and executes the corresponding templates based on the tags.
//
// Finally, it removes some commonly unrelated tag names.
//
// The logic is simple and can be further improved to increase execution coverage.
